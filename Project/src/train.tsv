5729993	Politicians have created an environment of disillusionment so bad that one is inclined to be cynical wen asked what would Sol Plaatjie, Nelson Mandela, Albert Sisulu, Albert Luthuli etc have done. A lot of current ANC politicians were disciplined ad principled people, but somehow the trappings of fancy houses, German sedans, free travel and easy access to young ad beautiful women seeking to share those privileges tend to make people change. So it is difficult to maintain with absolute certainty that Sol Plaatjie would have taken the high road.....	0	0
5592386	I work in downtown Ottawa so I will definitely check out this new restaurant. I went to their website, which is in French only (the language toggle is not working). I like the name, but it is weird to see the the blue design when I was expecting red and white (like a radish). I wonder if a basic issue is that the chain will mainly appeal to women (just like a very similar salad chain: Green Rebel) - so they are immediately cutting out 50% of the market. Another problem is that this is a lunch-only restaurant.	0	0

526384	"Cassie, I think what you say here is right on the money and very important.  The notion that Hillary Clinton viciously attacked the women who accused her husband has creeped into the national conversation as though it were a fact.  This report suggests that, at best, it’s an exaggeration:

http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-bill-clinton-accusers/

And from whence comes the exaggeration?  A quick Google search leads -- of course it does -- to Breitbart, the de facto public relations arm of the white supremacist movement and until recently the corporate home of Steve Bannon, the white-supremacist and anti-Semite who is now the CEO of the Trump campaign."	0	0

5629135	"Making oneself a painted target for every low-life in viewing distance is hardly a way to keep oneself safe, just like flashing a fat wad of cash around probably isn't a good idea either. One can be legally right and still wind up dead or badly injured. Life isn't always fair, but if you use a little common sense you increase the odds of avoiding bad outcomes. Why is that so hard for some to comprehend?
Encouraging women and girls to be blissfully stupid is a strange way to show you have the ""best interests"" of them in mind. Not only does it increase their chances of being accosted or worse, but if a trial does occur their attire and/or consumption of drugs&alcohol will certainly be a point of interest. Encouraging irresponsible behavior, as Nelson is unwittingly doing, actually makes it worse for those women who practice responsible behavior to receive justice when they are assaulted.

6047764	Respect is not a God given right, as far back as I can remember it had to be earned. Black men will never gain the respect of anyone until they learn to respect each other. 73% of all our black children are born out of wedlock in single parent homes. The black neighborhoods chicago and beyond are riddled with crime, drugs, gangs, prostitution, murder, blighted neighborhoods, domestic violence, no work and poor education. The number one cause of death of black men between the ages of 18 and 34 years is black on black HOMOCIDE!!!!!  How can they expect anyone to respect them when they in turn do not even respect each other. These millionaire football players are completely out of touch. If a police officer never killed another black person, there would not even be a little dent in their plight. The football players need to give back more than 60 seconds on their knees to their brothers. It will take generations of hard work, they need to be active in addressing the black problem	1	1

Feminists aren't going to be satisfied until there is a guilty until proven innocent standard for sexual assault cases. We can't let it happen.

940544	"Milo Yiannopoulos is a senior editor at Breitbart News. The creeps and freaks at Breitbart prop him up because, as a self-loathing gay man, MY is useful to them.

MY is pathetic, more to be pitied than scorned. His message is right wing cliches that are notable only because they are spewed by a gay man who both encourages gay men to stay in the closet and flaunts his own homosexuality for profit. To protest his appearances is to treat him more seriously than he deserves. On the other hand, of course, people have every right to protest if they so choose.

She ridiculed Damore's presentation with an attempt at being cute, ""Golly gee, if only I could overcome my natural biological disposition toward feelings rather than ideas..."".  It is at this point she confuses a statistical distribution of traits as a specific criticism of the female of the species.

As Damore's critique of the echo chamber at Google was validated by his expulsion so has Henein's fit of pique in defense of 'woman' reinforced the existence of her in-group bias.   How sad to see in-group bias be the source of perceived injury as it is in Henein's article,.

743189	Low fat during pregnancy is not a good idea. Fat is great for brain development because the brain is mostly fat. Studies have shown that a low fat diet during pregnancy can lead to post partum depression because of the body taking it from the mothe's brain to give to the baby. I eat only wild game and grass fed sources of fat. Luckily, I was able to keep down food like this thanks to pot and I believe that helped keep me from getting post partum depression. A lot of women end up on harsh anti depressants while nursing because of ppd and that's legal, socially acceptable because the pharmaceutical companies and doctors make money. I couldn't hold down fish oil until late pregnancy but once I could I took krill oil. I recommend you read a little about ppd and hg. You'll find you have no idea how impossible eating right can be for some women with hg and how hard hitting ppd can be.

  Marriage today is not marriage of 1000 years ago.  The roles of women in the world are not the roles of women 500, 1000, much less 2000 years ago.  And yet, the Church wants to act as if what they created as doctrine and teachings all those centuries ago still applies.   Patriarchal, divine-right rule is disappearing from the world, but the Church still insists that an organizational model they copied from the Roman Empire is the only organizational model God allows.  Gimme a break.  

There is too much idolatry of the Church within the Church.  I want the faith to continue on into the next centuries.  It doesn't have to be ""the Church"" of today, but the faith needs to go on.  It is not faith in the immaculate, infallible Church - it is faith in what Jesus gave us."	0	0

Ditto for a Buddhist monk in his robes. But for dark reasons they won't admit, the Quebec government will not provide government services to Muslim women in veils.

Read it and weep. Quebec's law isn't about security, it isn't about women's rights, and it isn't about secularity. It's about discriminating against Muslim women.

919152	The recently elected president is the model par excellence of a bully: he bullies women by forcing himself on them sexually, he bullies people who aren't white with his racist rhetoric, he bullies immigrants when he lies about their contributions to American society, he lies about trade. Trump is a psychopath as his behavior shows, and like his supporters he wants to do as much harm as possible to to the people he stigmatizes. He behaves like a criminal but has thus far gotten away with it. It's going to take more anti-racist white people to call out his filthy minions like Sessions and Bannon--these are the architects of his fascist regime.	1	0
5978784	"I listened to Scheer's response in the video where he describes the scenario of a woman being deprived of the ability to save for maternity leave within her corporation and I believe that  no one has explained clearly why we have these tax breaks for small corporations.

Are they meant to be tax incentives for taking risk and growing a company, or are they meant to be alternative pension and maternity plans?

If the former, then I agree that the small corps need a tax stimulus. If the latter, then I think that we should  find another way for the self employed to contribute to EI, pension plans, etc.

No one is going to convince me that doctors, for example,  are assuming any risk by setting up a corporation.

However, the absence of a pension plan and EI (through which one obtains federal maternity leave payments) is a real problem and I am surprised that none of the three parties has addressed this specifically."	0	0

 'Rape culture.'

'Rape' in the phrase is a strident rhetorical tag that puts a grim face on everything from unwanted gropes in offices to full on rape because women are sick of that spectrum of actions and want it to stop.  But by all means, dwell on the denotative particulars and miss the point and strategy of the phrase.  If a woman I knew got groped at work (or worse) and didn't use what I thought was the apt phrase?

This is a myth. Abusers often tell their victims, lawyers, judges, and therapists that they were abused as a child. It's a manipulation to gain sympathy and forgiveness. 

In one research study (cited in the book ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft) 70% of men convicted of abuse claimed to have been abused as a child.

So let me ask the taxpayer this: Do you want to pay Planned Parenthood for the birth control and education for the young would-be mom or would you rather pay for the actual birth in a hospital, plus the many 1000's of dollars the child's medical care will cost throughout its life.  Oh, and if they end up in the slammer due to a poor upbringing then you get to pay for that at roughly $40,000 per year.  But hey, maybe everything will break the way YOU want it to and somehow (a) the baby is born, and (b) the woman and child NEVER ONCE need federal assistance in any way.

Even though he did this out of the goodness of his heart, APD and the rest of the law enforcement game see him as a threat to their job security. When private citizens can police the city better than government bureaucracies people start to question why we pay and hire police who cannot do the job, public funding becomes uncertain and people in the government monopoly start getting scared.

ORS 163.415,  A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:

(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:

(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or

(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age; or

(b) For the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the person or another person, the person intentionally propels any dangerous substance at a victim without the consent of the victim.

(3) As used in this section, ""dangerous substance"" means blood, urine, semen or feces. 

10 years ago I knew a Lane County Deputy that went to work one day and when he went into his office he passed by his secretary, said Good Morning, and put his hand on HER shoulder as a friendly, warm gesture. She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?"	1	0

It's a step in the right direction. Merely semantics? Mas, non! 
It's important:   it eliminates the suggestion that complainants involved  made trivial or false or complaints.  I.e.: no judgement call.  Just not enough evidence to go forward, so...case remains ""unsolved.""  

Are advocacy groups satisfied?  No. One group's goal: encourage more women to come forward with complaints.  And this word change, they argue, won't do that.  Too bad: that's NOT the job of police forces.  That's the ADVOCATES' job.

Adding to the dumbness , in D.C. the organizers there told all women who are pro life to not show up .  They are excluding their own sisters because they don't like they're position on abortion. How pathetic is that ?  All those who march in D.C. support killing the nearly born through abortion. Talk about a sick group .The bottom line is these marches will mean nothing . Locally this march will mean even less.  All these women would be better off to hold a bake sale and give all the money to Planned Parenthood who's about to lose all federal funding.

Ms. Appleman--don't be paranoid about how much power Hillary Clinton can wield to effectuate these types of changes because it's very little. The reality is that the negativity and social dysfunction caused  by outdated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases create contradictions in society that all but the most desperately deluded (clearly, still a fair number of Americans) can see for themselves. These changes are already underway and while people are free to choose their own ideas for themselves, however backward, society will be required to grapple with basic issues such as racism, violence against women, income disparity and freedom of conscience for EVERYONE, not just groups receiving special rights to dominate others such as people calling themselves ""Christians"" and the very rich."	0	0

996167	First of all.  Edelman's catch was a freak of nature.  3 defensive players grabbing for the ball.  And all those bodies kept the ball in play.  No way that should have been caught without them.  Now putting that aside,  naming Brady for a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach is a thing of beauty.  Brady's hiss takes 3 forms:  a disturbance hiss which is applicable to Brady cus he is old and only older Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches can do that;  a female attracting hiss which I will not talk about at this time;  and the aggressive fighting hiss, which only Brady can qualify for that (a few years ago he made 2 TDs in the last minute of a game.)  Thus the zoo equating a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach with the Patriot QB is one of the greatest compliments of all time for Brady.   Remarkable!  But I still say that Edelman's catch was a freak of nature.  Then again with the Hissing Cockroach;  his fighting quality may have meant that if the catch was dropped he still may have pulled off a win.	0	0

5013634	Lay, replying here and to what you wrote to me above. Bart D. Ehrman points out that John of Zebedee was a Galilean fisherman and would likely not have had the necessary skill in Greek to write the Book of John. I'll add that perhaps John 21:24 means that the author has been informed by the testimony of someone who wrote earlier (perhaps John or Lazarus). Scholars often date the Book of John to a time (90 CE) when Apostle John would have been like age 90 (but maybe by then he had learned to write Greek?) I am not the least perturbed that women stand apart in the Synoptics and women stand by the cross in John. Maybe the women walked from one location to the other! Apostle John could possibly be the beloved disciple, but Lazarus is a better bet as the beloved and the original contributor to John, because Lazarus lived in Bethany and may have been more cosmopolitan than the sons of Zebedee, and also for reasons above. Who was the first scholar to propose John was the beloved at the cross?	0	0

On the abortion front, I have an idea that will highlight that liberals are not pushing for the health of women but for the death of unborn babies.   The U. S. Congress tried to take the first step in this earlier when they tried to defund Planned Parenthood.  They were going to switch the Planned Parenthood money to other clinics.   I say take it to the next step and re-open the closed clinics but do not provide abortions there.   The more we do stuff like this, the less liberals can say conservatives do not care about women's health.	0	0

Saw Ms. Rose last night at the 'Shoe, appropriately, though nothing compares to her old gigs at the Cameron, if you were lucky, with Colonel Tom opening.

Such a treasure.

Mix in Kitty Wells, Patsy Cline, a lot of Linda Ronstadt, some Dinah Washington and a big dollop of Johnny Cash (if he were a female!), package all of that in a terminally sweet diminutive little doll and you've got the essence of Whitney Rose.

New EP is superlative, with her strong songwriting and some of Country music's top studio guns (Red Volkaert, Earl Poole Ball and more).

Kudos to Six Shooter Records for putting Whitney into Austin (the germination factory of Real Country And Western Music) and stepping up with top-drawer album production and world tour.

Best Whitney ever? The night the power went out at The Cameron.

No problem for Whitney and her band - piano, snare drum, acoustic guitar, stand-up base, no mikes or amps (or lights!) - just Whitney singing her heart out at each table!

Fantastic!

It’s a compelling argument, but there’s no actual evidence that it’s true.

I can't explain why there are so few women, and I have run across a very few women engineers, so it isn't like women can't do this job.  I do wonder why so few enter the field.  I could imagine a portion of that is how ladies are raised...maybe the parents point them elsewhere or don't teach them things that would encourage engineering thinking?  Had I a daughter, she'd sure as heck be exposed to that stuff."	0	0

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Writing computer code however, is truly gender agnostic. The computer and the end user cannot tell the gender of the author of the code. The code must simply do what it is intended to do, be efficient and relatively bug free. Faster and more accurate coders are highly valued in the industry. 

The fact that there are relatively fewer women in computer programming in spite of decades of affirmative action and encouraging women to enter the field, tells us something about our society and the desire/ability of women to perform that type of work.

It is also not surprising that a blinkered feminist journalist is unable to hear what it is saying."	1	0

1031059	Abortion in late term pregnancy is done for the heath of the mother and many times because of fetal death and the fetus for some reason will not deliver. After fetal death in the womb the fetus decays and the toxins can cause maternal death. Late term abortions are also reserved for severe fetal birth defects not compatible with life.  Late Term abortion was used by Pro-Lifers to generate the impression that careless women wanted to abort their baby late term just on a whim.  The truth is that many pregnancies end because of  medical problems with the developing fetus and many pregnancies end in miscarriages due to malformation and problems with a woman's reproductive organs.  Pregnancy is risky. As a nurse the only late term abortions I have seen were rare and due to severe fetal deformity. The only way to reduce the need for abortion is access for a woman to reproductive family planning and low costs birth control. I know it worked for me for all the decades I was able to have kids.	0	0

He did not commit the sins of generations prior -- why should he do unlimited penance for them?

Moreover, it completely ignores the overall demographic shift and the fact that it takes many years, if not decades for a cohort to work its way through a system, and ultimately the trend is more important in determining what, if any action should be taken.

Not sure what they are teaching today but many young people would have had a different reaction to know they are destroying their own baby with a beating heart."	0	0

An Urban Insititute data analysis found that mortgage denial rates from government-sponsored servicers are higher for black applicants with bad credit than for white applicants with bad credit:

A study published this year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age. When participants were told that the boys, both black and white, were suspected of crimes, the disparity in perceptions of age and innocence became more stark:

White Americans use drugs more than black Americans, but black people are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites. Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found."	1	1

In doing so, both Pope and Paul were imitating Jesus who, in his legal discussions with Pharisees, seems to have almost always favored a pragmatic approach to any issue. Jesus' rejection of divorce is so startling that it stands out as one of the most historically authentic saying of Jesus, but it was addressed to men, for only they had the power to divorce, and soon an exception was made in case of porneia.

In contrast, a woman who does not agree with abortion on demand up to and including the completion of the third trimester is not by definition disinterested or against upholding the status of women. Which part of the distinction between the two scenarios that YOU posited does your mind have difficulty recognizing more than feebly? To be candid, I am surprised. Some of the other SJW posters here are so obviously incapable of grasping the contradictions. Despite your blinkered and often mulish contrarian stands, I would perceive you as being intelligent.

But look, writer, get out of my face when you try to use those words pejoratively, as an outsider who is not a member of that group. It is offensive and bigoted and does not help with the argument you try to make.

Now you are going to give the defendant the choice where he wants to be tried. He is going to want to be tried by his family and friends if he gets to a trial. Where are the victim's rights. Not only in sexual assault but in other major crimes. This tribal chief is no hero for the victim. He is now encouraging crime. I applaud the idea of the tribal systems policing itself but trying them in a very small community of friends and family is wrong. Find a way to get the trial out of the area. Nowhere near the town's influence, give the victim the choice and relocation and native hospital counseling, and the choice of trial locations either state or tribal.

It is hard not to feel a deep and long-running stream of misogyny in the effort to assert control over this most distinctly female power.

Yet if we compare Trump's potential actions against those actually taken by Obama -   a man who launched  500 drones killing people extra judicially, who destroyed Libya  and destabilised  the Western Sahel in the process, who went to war with Syria by supporting a covert war there (resulting in the deaths of at least 400,00 people and massive refugee flows) who spied on his allies and who ratcheted up  confrontation with Russia - Saunders is silent.

Why wasn't Saunders applauding when Trump quietly announced the CIA would no longer fund covert armed support to Syria's rebels?

When Trump offered an olive branch to Russia  to work out a common solution to the Syrian impasse, the war in Ukraine and the fight against ISIL, Saunders and his media brethren pushed back.

The Republicans in Congress have a lot more power over domestic policy. Unfortunately, this means they will be able to veto the Elect's intention to prevent the privatization of Medicare and Social Security, the abolition of Medicaid and the replacement of Obamacare with anything at all.

About 5 years ago, Canada gave away over 3 billion bucks to two countries: Afghanistan and Syria.  Good choices, no?

I don't disagree about there being a violent subculture, doing great harm within many Black neighborhoods.  Cliques of undirected and disenchanted young men and boys are one of the long-standing challenges of modern societies. Where a society understands those youths to be its own children and future, it tends to take seriously the job of engaging them productively. Where societies do not regard them as their own children, it's of little consequence what happens to them. 

Good luck with Anderson's book. She has a contentious thesis, but I think she does good work assembling an historically based overview. At the very least, it may give you a more detailed sense of the sorts of things people have in mind, when they argue the merits of taking an historical view of current conditions in Black communities, as I have tried to do here.

She was raised entirely in the U.S. speaking English and attending school in America.  Unfortunately her adoptive parents neglected to apply for U.S. citizenship for her.  When she was about 20 she got in some minor legal trouble (I can't remember exactly what - smoking pot or something similar), and because she couldn't prove citizenship (and up to this point, I'm pretty sure that she had no idea she WASN'T a U.S. citizen), she was deported to Niger (which I think may be the poorest country in the world) in the middle of Africa.

It is my understanding that pro life groups were not included in the sponsors of the March, but not denied the right to March and did have a visible presence in Washington.  The march in my State did not have this issue.  And of course the March was anti Trump because Trump was the one who implied he had a right to grab women's genitals and women would take it.  Hence the cat eared pink hats.  Do pro life women agree with Trump's take on women, because otherwise I am at a loss as to why all the angst.  At least three of my pro life friends marched on Saturday.  I never ran into them because the March was way bigger than we expected."	0	0

5319853	"Part 2.  

The problem at the deepest level is that we learn language on the basis that white is the social norm and basically invisible.  For instance, a stand-up comedian starts a routine with ""A man walks down the street and is approached by a black man.""  The first man is unraced, and the natural implication is that he is white.  The second man is raced.  Black people in language are almost always raced.  White people are almost always unraced.  The racing of the approaching man is intended to supply information about him, and the information is stereotypically intended to be negative.  

While I appreciate the efforts of Canada to educate people on this issue, the subject matter touches language structure, societal perceptions arising from hundreds of years of layered presuppositions, and historical stereotyping, including the use of biblical passages to justify treating peoples as inferior or savages.

608231	In a recent NY Times article about an incident at a Brooklyn restaurant in which a Trump supporter punched a woman in the face who dared to criticize Trump, one commenter mentioned that she and her dinner companion recently found themselves speaking in hushed tones at a restaurant for fear of some sort of reprisal from nearby listeners. (I gather this was a very red locale.) She then went on to say that the last time she found herself behaving that way was on the eve of the Iraq War when anyone who dared criticize Bush's planned invasion was branded a traitor. So here we are all over again. Funny how that always happens whenever Republicans win everything on the table. They start grabbing everything in sight like wild-eyed winners at a Vegas casino.

If presumably you did this the constitutional way and had Congress move personhood to gastrulation (too much evidence shows it is not before that point) under its 14th Amendment power, every fetal death could involve a lawsuit. How would you deal with malpractice carriers not allowing their clients to see women until the second trimester?  These are the real questions which come up.  It won't be like before 73, where in most cases the penalty for abortion was a fine on the doctor, the same penalty as shooting your neighbor's dog.

That would presumably include me — but it doesn’t, and that is where the dismissal of voter concerns about Clinton led to her defeat. I most certainly reject the trifecta of “hatred/division/ignorance.” I support the Democratic Party’s position on abortion, same-sex marriage and climate change.

This is nothing more than a stunt that sadly will fool many.

A) Poor people without insurance need health care too. B) Planned Parenthood provides women's health care for free to anyone.  PP does these thru donations and grants from the States and Fed and Charity Foundations.  No Federal money is allow to be spent on abortions.  The people protesting Planned Parenthood know this, but have decided that a zygote is a person.  These same people believe that Corporations are persons too.  Once again, POOR women get help with birth control via Planned Parenthood.  POOR people mostly do not have insurance, and less will have insurance as soon as the GOP gets done gutting ACA.  POOR women cannot afford to go to Dr for prescription birth control, therefore Planned Parenthood is necessary.	1	0

""For many observers, a chief focus of the current campaign has been the crass and increasingly threatening language of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has bragged about demeaning and groping women. In the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, Trump also reiterated that he believes the Nov. 8 election has been ""rigged"" and that he might contest any result that did not favor him.
But the U.S. bishops have been virtually silent on those topics, while some have continued to highlight the centrality of opposition to abortion and gay marriage.""

Strong allegations there, Brother William.  The most positive evidence I have for women in church leadership, comes from the history of the Adventist church.  In the early days many (arguably most) Millerites rejected the ministry of Ellen White.  Even such SDA stalwarts as Joseph Bates, struggled mightily over this very question.

Times DO change.  In NT times it became OK to accept uncircumcised Gentiles as God's children.  In the 1800s it became OK to accept the spiritual leadership of a woman prophetess.  Both of those developments were highly divisive in church history.  Many of those believers would rather die than admit that God could do such a thing.  But He did, and they did."	0	0
