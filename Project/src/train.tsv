716291	"Of course some women experience emotional and physical trauma, during and after abortions. I've never said otherwise. I was just noting that if this choice is presented as a ,matter of risk assessment, women run greater risk when they carry a pregnancy to term, and it is dishonest to suggest otherwise. 

I am not willing to think of proven falsehoods as ""information."" Nor can I admire organizations that dress volunteers up in lab-coats, to dispense such ""information""  as though it were substantiated fact. Also, I do not think that any tactic that keeps an abortion from occurring  is by definition morally sound. These views often bring me into conflict with anti-abortion advocates.

 I'm told some theologians have regarded lying as the most grave of the capital sins, because of the violence lies do to the pre-eminent human project of seeking Truth.

5961177	"Nora, what you have said about the Twelve as judges is so important in debating JPII's Mulieris Dignitatem and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis against women priests. Do you realize Catechism #1577 sets bishops up as a continuation of the ""college of the twelve""? But there was no continuation after Matthias' election. Paul says he is an apostle. Paul distinguishes himself from 'super-apostles,' presumably the 12, but also says he is not inferior to them (2Co 11:5 and 12:11 NRSV). Despite Paul not being part of the 'college of 12,' the bishops consider themselves to be its continuation. The bishops think they are Gentile judges of Israel under a New Covenant?? Mt 19:28 has 12 thrones, but not Lk 22:30. Also 24 thrones in Revelation

This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)

We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.

When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.

708942	"Do tell us women about the ""significant difference."" Most abortions happen when the embryo is at the stage of development that most miscarriages occur at so on the one hand you have Nature, (or in the minds of the credulous--God the Father, Jesus Christ and whoever else occupies the Christian pantheon), who eliminates the embryos chance to be born and on the other women making a conscious and legally protected (Roe v. Wade, 2nd Amendment) decision surrounding their bodies. 
The difference which you claim is ""significant"" really isn't in terms of the clump of cells you call an unborn child. The clump of cells can't exist without the woman to whom it belongs. What is significant, though, and you seem to conveniently forget, is the free will of women to make decisions about their bodies.

5806856	As a white person I have never known white supremacy and most other white people haven't either.  That is just a label minorities pin on whites for their own short comings.  The proof was in the 44th president, arguably the most powerful person in the world who was awarded the Nobel prize.  This should have been a conference on attaining more opportunities for minorities, not taking away from another group.  A rising tide rises all ships so it is in the best interest of all Americans to promote opportunities for all without taking away from others.  As long as minorities can claim they are not successful because the white man holds them back the longer they will be unsuccessful.	0	1

The Temperance movement had a particularly Christian flavour to it, and it was under the guidance of religion that the Temperance movement won voting rights for women in Canada. Or how about the Social Gospel movemment of western Canada, which used Protestant teachings to rally labourers and farmers to unionize, winning them better working conditions. Or the famed Tommy Douglas, who was a preacher, also influenced by Social Gospel, whose witness of suffering eventually kicked off a personal crusade that after a decade led to the formation of social programs like medicare?

825396	"These numbers are important. From 1946 to 2015, the labour force participation went from 55% to 66% This was due to women in the work force going from 25% to 62%. These numbers can explain an increase in unemployment and a downward effect on salaries. 

This meant a large gain for employers - more workers to chose from, and no need to keep salaries up. 

What caused the increase in the labour force? In the 1960s there was an increase in the number of articles in the media about women in the work force. Seldom an article on women at home. Thus women were being coerced, subtlety to join the work force. The number of articles increased until by the 90s one virtually had to be in the work force to be anybody. The articles continue with disastrous results for women. They have the maternal responsibilities and a market place which is hostile. Downward push on salaries, fewer  jobs. Lots of competition.

You are also probably aware of the treaty-making event  on top of Table Rock and what happened  to the small group of white men there amidst a large number of Takelma warriors, when the runner arrived with the story of a terrible  murder of Takelma by whites.

There is nothing wrong with turning the narrative of that initial encounter between European explorers and indigenous people over to indigenous peoples to tell. After all, Columbus wasn't the only party in that initial encounter.

Through the fellow mothers in the League of Women Voters, many who were university professors wives, I joined a parent's group for multi-culturalism to be taught in our schools, and to employ more minority teachers as role models. Eventually I co- chaired the group, working with the school supertindent and school board. I awakened to what was left out of AMERICAN History courses of minority contributions. Teachers were reluctant, they were required mandatory training in multicultural education. No child should feel that they are unimportant. We parents were fortunate to work with a good school supertindent and school board who genuinely cared for the children's well being, learning experience.	0	0

Yes.  Making effective contraceptives available has already reduced the number of abortions and I do believe that a social attitude that pregnancies should be planned is important to reducing unplanned pregnancies - the primary reason women seek abortions.  Making abortions illegal won't stop abortions, just send them underground, as they were in the past.  The way to have the greatest effect on reducing the number of abortions is to make use of contraceptives and planned pregnancies the standard.

An obvious dichotomy of thought that you attribute to God and I attribute to men ( not even all people ) trying to parse out their faith. You insist you have God's words absolutely right, to the point of requiring no explanation and needing no interpretation. These are not Catholic thoughts, despite the fact that you and the church hierarchy have portrayed them that way. They are stops on the journey. Am I sure about that? No, I'm never sure what God wants. But your intransigence on this simple tangential point of falling/ soaring shows more about you than it does about God. As for me, I believe God is present in Her world more than in the rules of the searchers. That makes me Catholic, a believer in the universal church that you and others would prefer deny the universe.	0	1

One comment re the headline however: I am sick unto death of the milk-soppy phrase ""domestic abuse"". WTH is that anyway? I know how it arose, I've been around that long--it was an attempt to get away from the heterosexist ""wife beating"" label.

But ""domestic abuse"" is idiotic--and misleading, and a misrepresentation. It is not domesticity that is being abused, nor is it ""domestics"".

It's assault within a partner relationship--and even that's a bit slippery: typically, it's woman-battering.

If we can't name it more precisely, we are never going to be able to change it.

While my preference is that women have information about sex and birth control in order to avoid unwanted pregnancy, I am old enough to remember the days of back alley abortions. Wasted or damaged lives were often the result. Playing games with women's lives because they might become inadvertently pregnant is a way to control women and take us back to places we don't want to live in. If ""pro-life"" believers want to force women to have children then there should be financial support for the children, day care support so the woman can work after the first years and access to multiple support options, especially for young women so they can continue education and have the opportunity for a reasonable life. Without that access, access to safe abortion is necessary.

There are all kinds of fathers, and all kinds of brothers, and many of them are not very nice at all. Also our relationships with advocates or defenders or ""consolers"" can vary as well; and there is no need at all why any of those people should be male. So the fixation on the choice of male gender in these cases as somehow revealing The Way Things Are, Like It Or Not, strikes me as an unnecessary, optional, culturally determined phenomenon.

And that's fine, so long as we recognize it as such. ""Menu-crushing,"" btw, means imposing uniformity, eliminating options.

741668	Excellent memories of Christmas past. A few years back I was working in a place that had a variety of races and religions and we all got along well. One individual was a muslim and a very smart and well spoken man. I wished him a Merry Christmas and initially he seemed to dislike my Christmas greeting. We discussed it and I asked him if he would be upset if he wished me well on Ramadan in what ever traditional way is called for and I took exception to it. He told me he would understand if that would upset me. I asked him if by giving a Ramadan greeting, he was insulting me or wishing bad things to me? He thought about it and told me that he would not be wishing bad for me. I then informed him that I would take it in the spirit it was given, even if it were not a Christian greeting and could he also take my greeting in the spirit given? Thinking about my statement, he then smiled and said, yes and wished me a very Merry Christmas. That was a very good day. Nothing bad about being nice.	0	1

Yet if we compare Trump's potential actions against those actually taken by Obama -   a man who launched  500 drones killing people extra judicially, who destroyed Libya  and destabilised  the Western Sahel in the process, who went to war with Syria by supporting a covert war there (resulting in the deaths of at least 400,00 people and massive refugee flows) who spied on his allies and who ratcheted up  confrontation with Russia - Saunders is silent.

Why wasn't Saunders applauding when Trump quietly announced the CIA would no longer fund covert armed support to Syria's rebels?

When Trump offered an olive branch to Russia  to work out a common solution to the Syrian impasse, the war in Ukraine and the fight against ISIL, Saunders and his media brethren pushed back.

Hence, no physical harm was done to the woman, so no compensation for that can be claimed. That leaves claims for damages arising from more tangential issues, but there again what would have to be clearly established were the cabbie's actions. Heaping conjecture about that on top of conjecture about the woman's behavior doesn't prove much in the balance of probabilities equation.

Hypothetical scenario: cabbie accepts heavily intoxicated passenger. He follows her mixed up instructions on where to turn, and winds up lost. She's so intoxicated that she urinates in the back seat, pulls off her soaked clothing, and then passes out. And that's when a police cruiser just happens to come by.

The 2014 campaign was filled with ad hominem attacks from many sides, with some really awful and untrue attacks leveled at Parnell (he didn't have the public interest at heart, just Conoco's) and Sullivan (recall he wanted a war on women and was in the Koch brothers' pocket).  We didn't have good faith policy disagreements in 2014. Indeed it was virtually impossible to engage in civil discourse on tax policy.

6089615	"The Church has already ""confronted"" the issue of women's ordination.  A final  decision on that issue has been reached.  The Church has no authority to ordain women.  I don't understand why this is not clear to dissidents.  What would the Church have to do before they finally realize this cannot change? Why do they act like this issue is open for discussion or that the Church can somehow ""move forward"" on this issue. 

The deaconate is, at this time, in theory open to women.  That question has not been answered definitively. However, research into this issue has already been done as to what the deaconate was in the early Church.  The conclusion has been that it was not what is understood today to be the Sacrament of Holy Orders deaconate.  

Whatever the case may be--what is known with certainty at this time is that women will never be ordained to the priesthood or episcopate.  There is no ""moving forward"" on this.  Rome has spoken, the case is closed."	0	0

That is simply not true, and I will use a simple example to demonstrate why: Rosa Parks. Refusing to give up her seat was not an act of hyperbolic demonstration. It was a simple, firm, eloquent and brave action that defied the oppressive racist laws and attitudes at the time. Indeed, I would argue that the very opposite is true: most often it is the oppressor who is guilty of hyperbole - all oppression being necessarily hyperbolic in order to be effective.

The women protesting here are neither being ridiculous or offensive - even if you are personally offended. They are using a well understood visual symbol of the oppression of women, drawn from a widely-read novel and popular television adaptation. Their protest is poetic, and outspoken, and perhaps effective, but it is not hyperbolic. You reaction seems less measured, less considered by comparison - somewhat... hyperbolic?"	0	0

Now its up to the business how they want to deal with it.  Ultimately they can quickly react and MAYBE alienate their larger customer base to be more, or they can do research and polls and figure out how what their customer base wants/is comfortable with.

5726547	"""West should elaborate on why she thinks a pro-life stance is an offense against ""racial justice""""
She may be surmising, with good warrant, that poor women of color would suffer more from the consequences of a ban than their more privileged sisters.  Strange as her prose is, I don't think she was proposing that there was no racial injustice currently influencing the reproductive choices of poor minorities. 

West is apparently conflating a ""pro-life stance"" with an abolitionist agenda. Her reluctance to welcome and support candidates in favor of outlawing abortion into the Democrat party may be, as MSW says, politically inexpedient for the party itself. But if West holds a strong commitment to women's rights in their bodies, as seems to be the case, it's hardly surprising that she'd see supporting candidates that favor abolition as both politically unhelpful and morally problematic."	0	0

The real story is the treatment of the mentally ill - and it's a nationwide issue. I don't know what the answer is; however, it appears that at least Parker, CO is going to try something new. See ""Mental illness calls on the rise in Parker, police start different approach to fight the problem"" on Channel 7's site. I wish them well with the new approach and hope it can be a template for other law enforcement departments if it does."	0	1

What was Wespac's big conservation measure in the Pacific?  I've known Wespac for a quarter century and cannot recall any conservation measure they implemented by their own free will.  It's usually the court's will.

National Marine Fisheries Service created the longline exclusion zones because Hawaii's fishermen and threatened and endangered species demanded it.

As you know, Wespac's ""management"" led to the crash of NWHI lobster stocks, not once but twice.  Wespac shifted into high gear by supporting the take of berried females and juveniles, so the court stepped in and shut it down.

As Trump's campaign is seriously lacking funding since he said he did not need any donors to answer to it appears that Trump's handlers are on a different mission to fund that campaign and do it now. Trump needs Pence to go beg for money. When Trump announced the VP he let Pence hang around in the background and barely noted him. Obvious Trump is a total one man show.

Most don't have an issue with people choosing their religion, but with some of the beliefs such as women are property and must hide themselves, that non-believers are to be shunned or harmed, or that their beliefs are above the law in Canada (that is what sharia is).

I can teach my son that women are equal but it is not going to matter if someone who believes otherwise teaches their seven children that women are property and that their cultural beliefs are to be followed over and above the law.  The root of this motion is from the sharia and we should all be concerned."	0	0

It's important for a workplace or organization to set out in advance the standards to be expected - the rules.  The Globe has done that.  

It's not so important to set out consequences for violating the standards, although the Globe has set out a range.  They aren't usually set out in specific 'you do this and here's exactly your punishment' form.

The nature of the standards themselves allow for subjective judgment.  What some call 'politically incorrect' is often what some call rude and uncivil. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but does lead to arguments.

A) Poor people without insurance need health care too. B) Planned Parenthood provides women's health care for free to anyone.  PP does these thru donations and grants from the States and Fed and Charity Foundations.  No Federal money is allow to be spent on abortions.  The people protesting Planned Parenthood know this, but have decided that a zygote is a person.  These same people believe that Corporations are persons too.  Once again, POOR women get help with birth control via Planned Parenthood.  POOR people mostly do not have insurance, and less will have insurance as soon as the GOP gets done gutting ACA.  POOR women cannot afford to go to Dr for prescription birth control, therefore Planned Parenthood is necessary.	1	0

- Laity, especially those that lead households of faith, Domestic Churches, must never ignore knowledge of clerical high crimes and misdemeanors. Rule of thumb: if one thinks that the bishop has to resolve a situation like the rape of a child by a cleric, then one needs also to report the crime or serious misdemeanor to civil and secular authorities.

""BORN on THIRD BASE : a one per center makes the case for tackling inequality and bringing the wealthy home and committing to the common good. "" by Chuck Collins

Just finished reading an interview with someone who took up the Pope's challenge way back when he was 26 when he gave up his millions of inheritance. New focus addressing economic inequality and environmental issues. Chuck Collins was 'born on third base' which is an awesome way to say 1% -er with a fabulous visual of just what that 'means' in real life. Connect that visual to what Pope Francis speaks to and Chuck Collins writes a ""face for the rich man"" born on third base... in the Gospel. Chuck's choice? go for home!

This happens in most management scenarios, regardless of the person's sex.

What you need to do is NOT take ownership of the idea, as this means nothing. You should just be happy that the company incorporates the idea moving forward, as it means the idea had merit.

Also the best ideas are often immediately rejected by the status quo, only to be excepted later as situations evolve... or as the submitter of the idea is able to make a better case over time.

You stated ""when will we hold the bishops responsible for their political doublespeak about not supporting or opposing....."".  Exactly HOW do we go about holding bishops responsible for much of anything?  In so many ways, they are like our new President-elect.

They don't gather the 'regular"" Catholics that they lead to engage in dialogue & discussion with them.  They don't visit where the poor, abused [especially women and children], homeless---gather for help. 

Among themselves, they, the USCCB, doesn't work TOGETHER or work on formulating anything.  About the last time that they together produced a document of Catholic Social Teaching was
""Strangers No Longer:  Together on the Journey of Hope"" [2003].  That is a poor record!  So, how do we, the laity, hold bishops responsible?"	0	0

This link it has a study on who gets welfare in the US. The increase is of people working low paying jobs that rely on welfare to subsidize their income and single women with children who are the head of the household. The average pay out for monthly assistance is 400. a month per household. There are millions of low income seniors and the disabled getting assistance. The Federal Poverty Level Guidelines for a single person ranges from 12,060 - 16,643 income a year. So a fulltime minimum wage job with 7.an hour base pay averages 14,000 a year income. A way to get people off of welfare that can work, is to raise the minimum wage and create jobs so that people can make more money or help to train people for jobs so they can earn more money. The military is a choice for many low income youth but they find they get low wages and often not train for jobs that they can work later."	0	0

After you finish patting yourself on the back, do you ever pause to wonder why all stores are set up that way?

They have only one or a very few issues that are important to them and if the politician meets their requirements in that area, the rest of what he does or doesn't do or say, they ignore.

Perfect examples here:

Abortion/woman's right to choose.

Banning guns/2nd Amendment rights.

If Trump is on the 'correct' side in either of those two issues, those advocates ignore everything else.

The first two changed will cause the clergy to be more representative of the people they serve, and the third will cause the clergy to recognize their authority derives from below; and taken together, ""clericalism"" as we currently know it, will be transformed into something else, hopefully something based on earned respect from below rather than respect demanded from above."	0	0

Authors Foster and Kimport highlight the characteristics of women seeking abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation.  The authors acknowledge that, in fact, wider “data suggests that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”[11] The study explores reasons for delay in seeking abortion services, comparing first-trimester and late-term abortion groups.  While there are numerous limitations to the study, the authors suggest that the characteristics of women who seek both first-trimester and late-term abortions are substantially similar."""	0	0

He did fail to reach Asia, but I'd like to see how Patkotak would have reached it from the Caribbean Sea, had she been in his position. 

Like other men of his age, Columbus did not believe in the equality of man, either racially or socially.  He believed that the Arawak Indians he found were inferior because of their simple technology and lack of complex institutions.  He thought that, with conversion to Christianity, the Indians would eventually become civilized. The harsh treatment he meted out to them was standard in many parts of Europe.

Columbus was very much a great man in the heroic mold.  He conceived of something grand and dared to put his plan into action, despite years of disappointment in finding a financial backer.  When he got his chance, the voyage was indeed a daring one for its day."	0	1

5195825	Just how little has changed was driven home for me on Friday when I heard that Trump again referred to Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” in his speech to the NRA. I understand that he’s afraid of Warren; he always has been. I also understand that he thinks her claim to have a Native American heritage presents a political opportunity for her opponents -- but his use of the name of a Native American hero as a slur demeans him and the presidency. During the election, I sometimes referred to Trump as “Dirty Donald”, imitating his proclivity for naming his political foes (Little Marco, Lyin’ Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.); it seemed appropriate shorthand for a man who has lived a filthy life personally, professionally and politically. I discontinued the reference on November 9, not because I suddenly acquired respect for him, but because I do respect the office to which he was elected. It’s too bad he doesn’t respect it. What a despicable, filthy, cowardly, petty little man this president is.	1	1

I do take issue with some of the crazy, wild things I have heard from the mouths of some who have been ordained as they are way out there in some form of new age theology. I was appalled when a young 'lady' studying for the ministry at Andrews showed up at my church to speak one Sabbath wearing a pin stripped man's suit, tie and shoes. The entire church was appalled and our church had two women elders who were very sincere, dedicated Christian Sisters. 
In today's culture it is very difficult  to be biblical in many ways and we will unfortunately see many things creeping into the church to compromise and distract us from our goals. But we need to quit the bickering and get on with the Father's Business on this earth so we can go home. We read about 1/3 of the angels leaving the throne with Lucifer. Let' not be among them."	0	0

He is so full of hate for women, gays, Jews, Muslims, liberals, blacks, and others, that it didn't make sense that he claimed to be gay and part-Jewish. Now, pedophile makes sense. 

The alt-Right often confuse pedophilia with homosexuality when they are, in fact, unrelated. Was Milo abused at 13? That would make sense. But then he should be in therapy and not lashing out.

Then again, that's the cycle of abuse. The abused becomes the abuser. Milo thinks he's being strong by spewing hatred of women, gays, Jews, Muslims, blacks and others. He's just compensating for his own lack of self-worth."	1	0

Trump is a rich ""playboy"" who cheats his business partners and contractors, gropes women, fires people for entertainment, employs illegals for dirt wages,  trades wives in like last year's Buick, and has never read a book. The last thing Trump is, is ""innocent"", unless you mean ""innocent of  wisdom"". Trump says he ""loves the working people"" but if you believe that, you are truly incapable of rational thought. What is astonishing is that 42 million Americans voted for him, in spite of the fact that Trump would take away their jobs, support and health care.

The drama has only begun to unfold. Comey was very careful not to leak or perjure himself. His classified information will go to the Senate committee in closed session.

Women in our hierarchy would have lessened our abuse rate and would have made the priesthood less appealing to pedophiles.

The 'residents' waded through traffic to the corner store for booze adding to the risk that someone was going to get hit in a drug or alcohol induced stupor. No one felt safe walking along that sidewalk. I saw a woman jogging along there yesterday, free from having to dodge trash and people. If there are children living under the bridge, then City/County social services should be working with them first to get them in a stable situation. Its no place for children. Continued stacking of the homeless under the bridge means that the folks trying to use the horseshoe pits and basketball courts are going to go somewhere else and that will just exacerbate the problem.

This law is a good argument for pulling out and dusting off the disallowance power of the federal government, rather than forcing people to have to raise a court challenge against it...since it will inevitably lose.

Because, as I have said elsewhere, if the goal is to get people to integrate, using force like this just makes them double down and dig in on their threatened identity.

5240558	"I've regarded this novel highly since it came out. As far as prophetic dystopian fiction goes, it belongs next to Orwell's book.  They are both pretty dismal. This production is timely, given the sense of fracturing current in our republic, with some states leaning hard in a theocratic direction.  The premise that women's fertility is something women are not qualified to manage on their own, but rather is a proper locus of social determination, (and, arguably, patriarchal domination) is  particularly apt. 

Given the intensity of the vision Atwood offers, I suspect it is not hard to discount.  Most conservative social theorists  can surely say that this is not at all what they have in mind. Nonetheless, a sceptic may note the common agenda of removing reproductive choice from women, and mark that once that decision has been made, there is no natural limit to the constraints that may be placed upon women, to ensure that that essential self-determination is denied."	0	0

Re:  Pauline/Petrine privileges  Yes, they are unusual exceptions.

Our custom is to require that anyone 'ordained' to priesthood or Episcopal office needs to be a full time CLERIC, dedicated for life. 

In the early Christian communities of Acts and the Epistles, that was not a requirement. These new greek-named 'deacons' were part of the 'laity'. The people Paul describes as having all the various gifts the community needed to 'build up the Body of Christ' were all of the same 'class'. Christians were not yet separated into 'laity' and 'clerics'. 

As long as we divide Christians into 'professional clerics' and 'laity', we will have 'clericalism'.

In both cases, it lets a couple be involved in a faith community as the Pastor--with all the liturgical leadership and other tasks of full ministry, but allows for time to share in raising children, if they want to raise a family;  for others, a less demanding leadership of smaller churches that can allow a couple to live a slower life, with more time for enjoyment of other sides of life than the often hectic life of a parish pastor.  It allows smaller churches which cannot support a family on a single parish to share that ministry with another parish; both gain a trained Pastoral leader, without financially stressing the family.

You said that you were critical of Trump because he isn't doing what he said he'd do fast enough.  There's word going around that part of this decision is to take those measly dollars spent on care for trans folks and divert towards funding for the border wall.

The Army routinely visit Rohingya farms in large numbers, take anything of value, and if the Rohingya say ONE WORD or show a DEFIANT LOOK, they burn down one of their outbuildings.

If there are reprisals, the Army returns in a few days and kills that family. If there are further reprisals, then the Army and non-Army Buddhists return and burn down the entire village, sometimes rape the women and take off with the livestock.

It's been this way for decades.

614887	"What baloney. Civility starts at the top. Take off the rose-colored glasses.

It's not civil to have known vocal racists as close supporters,  shove your tongue or your fingers into women who did not consent for you to do so, call a POW weak, call Hispanics rapists and murderers,  lump all people of Muslim faith as terrorists and make them enter a registry, and issue a call to arms to have your opponent murdered,  or thrown in jail.

GOP supporters in MY workplace are too busy bashing the liberal Democrats to stop and think for one second they could be working WITH liberal Dems , and are saying hurtful and mean things that paints them as sore winners and creates workplace resentment.

All the racist acts that have , and are,  still happening now post-election are a mirror of the complete lack of common human civility that resides in the president-elect, and a staggering portion of the people who voted for him."	1	0

It is statistically proven by research, studies, and law enforcement stats that white men are at the top of the list for child rape and child sex killings. White men also commit the most heinous crimes of any group in the country, serial killings being at the top, studies show.
In 2010, the Justice Department reported a disturbing trend where ""American child sex tourists typically are Caucasian males aged 40 or older. Such predators may be either situational or preferential child sex tourists. . . Some organizations estimate that U.S. citizens account for 25 percent of child sex tourists worldwide, and as high as 80 percent in Latin America."""	1	1

5085228	There are many other ways to protect the victims of abuse. Simply housing them in a facility (in almost like a half-way house) is NOT empowering them. Instead, it keeps them reminded that they are victims and now victims of a system where they are oppressed yet again. The reason that the other states do not have such shelters is already stated. For example, in a system where equal rights are sustained, why are women with children denied of such a service? Yes, because it would be too expensive to house women with children. That alone violates equal opportunity. There are services available to women who are victims of abuse. And we have a police and sheriff's deputies that can check on these victims regularly without having to have them isolated from the population. Police presence alone will help dissuade abusers from threatening or assaulting their victims. We have counselors that can do the job for far less than housing them for about two years. This project is not cost effective.	0	0

In a previous article on Berkley protests, the accompanying photo showed a white male doing what appeared to be the Nazi salute, whilst flanked by minorities, ostensibly his political compatriots. The clear suggestion was that the Trump supporters have a few neo-Nazis in them.

This is no different from someone who tells racist jokes after making sure there are only white people around to hear. It's the same as ridiculing someone's disability behind their back.
The important point here actually isn't whether Trump actually did the things he so childishly boasted about (although if he did grope and kiss people without their consent, he should be charged appropriately). The point is that our President must uphold the American principle of equality. He must make decisions based on what's best for all Americans.

They don't want to do the 4-5 masses that their parish requires each weekend but that is what a priest does.  I do all the masses on the weekend & weekdays, he would say-it is not that hard.  

I believe it is probably ideal for the parishes to have more than one priest but it does stick in the craw a bit that many of these priests complain all the time & don't realize they are complaining to women who would give a chuck of thier flesh to have the opportunity they complain about.

I know some priests in some areas have multiple parishes to deal with but again how many of these priests stand up for women to be ordained instead of just remaining obediently silent while they watch their sisters denied their vocation entirely.  I can be only so sympathetic."	0	0
5040649	As an Alaskan physician, I wish to give an opposing view from Dr. Tomsen. She indicates women in rural areas rely on PP clinics for their healthcare and 75% of PP clinics are in underserved areas. How many and where are the PP clinics in AK? There are exactly 4, one each in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and Soldotna. Maybe Soldotna could be considered rural. The same women's healthcare minus abortion can be obtained in federally qualified Community Health Centers who also provide general medical care for all comers. And that is regardless of ability to pay. How many CHCs are in AK? 86 at last count on alaska.gov. The vast majority are in villages. I know as I have worked in many of them. To say women's healthcare will suffer if PP federal funding in ended is false and fear mongering. At worst PP will reduce the # of clinics. CHCs are increasing every year. PP is not just doing abortions but getting funds from body parts. I don't want my taxes contributing to that in any way.	0	0

When an embryo does not implant that is not a death of a person or a person with a soul.  It certainly is not murder or Mother Nature would be guilty of mass murder every day.  An Embryo is a structure created by the unification of sperm and egg or the insertion of a skin, or other cell, into an evacuated ovum and then stimulated to divide.  So each and every cell in the human body has a potential to become a pluripotent embryo.  When does this structure become a person or have a soul?  No church has been able to adequately define that.

In each case union jobs left, high paying work was automated, other groups seemed to been rising while they fell, and services that were paid for by a civil society (health, tuition, taxes) were increasingly resting on their shoulders...they were told this was freedom. No, it was stupid! It's time to hear their pain and not belittle it...it's real even if their own damn fault. So what can we do? First is to stop pitting each against the other. Working class black mem and white men have a lot in common...helping to raise families, paying for college, dealing with a spouse who works too. They also are dealing with changes. Let's help them do both!	1	1

Yep, his letter wandered between conflicting viewpoints.
Companies were covering birth control until conservative Christians threatened to boycott those companies, so they dropped it.

6004147	As I said before, I think your reading is superficial. The Genesis stories are somewhat allegorical and display a very deep understanding of Man (collectively) God and, in a way, how we arrived here. They are not, to me, myths. They are stories that mankind passed down from one generation to the next until someone set them down, they tell truth in an allegorical (not literal) way. The underlying theology in Genesis is remarkable and one can ponder them for years. Sometimes there is a human-like figure who is sometimes equated with Christ (The Son of Man was there from the beginning). The Jews did not allow graven images of God because they knew that he could not be represented as He is far beyond our imagining. God did indeed know that Cain killed Abel, he was looking for an answer from Cain as any parent would do when asking a child about doing something wrong. MichaelAngelo was an artist and he used the old man representation as an artist does to show God. Out of characters!	0	1

Your bizarre take on the sexuality of the Hawaiian women, which wasn't shared by Cook's sailors, evokes the New England missionaries to Hawai`i.  It was an eye-opener for me to read your words.  I thought such extreme ethnocentrism was long gone.

The practice of archaeology has led me to admire the genius of Oceanic peoples in general and Hawaiians in particular.  I recently used my training as an anthropologist to investigate some misunderstandings between the British and kanaka maoli, as reported in the diaries of Cook and his officers.  I wrote up the investigation in the hope that it would help historians get past some of their ethnocentrisms, so they might glimpse a bit more of Hawaiian genius.
