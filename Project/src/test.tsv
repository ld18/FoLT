620211	Oh please stop with your fear mongering about women - it is a very tired argument, and speaks volumes about how little you understand about America today.  Hiring someone for the most important job on the planet just because of their body parts is idiotic - she lied, got caught lying and lied more about it.....
555462	"I have said all along that Trump could win, and some polls show him ahead today.

Your remark that polls showed Carter ahead can work both ways. If polling shows Trump to be ahead, he still could lose, even by a landslide.  I would hate to see this nation under Trump, who doesn't know jack about governance, and thinks going bankrupt is the way to get ahead, and grabs girls and women by the p@$$y as a way to get acquainted. Maybe he and his buddy Vladimir can fix everything up in the Middle East?  Frankly, I think anyone who admires Trump is a creep, imbecile, or sociopath.  But hey! that's half the whities in Amurca!"
377724	Not a child. He's a grown man. No need to apologize for the Alaska land sale program; he paid and signed knowing that it was a remote parcel of land that could have wetlands. That dude was extremely lucky that trooper was in the right place at the right time.
308490	"What is wrong with these democrats.

""The ideal of Republican motherhood pervaded the entire nation, greatly enhancing the status of women and demonstrating girls' need for education. The polish and frivolity of female instruction which characterized colonial times was replaced after 1776 by the realization that women had a major role in nation building and must become good republican mothers of good republican youth.""

Trump on the other hand, refers to women in so many demeaning terms, including ""piece of a*s"". He cheated on his wife, had a child out of wedlock, bilked banks, contractors, taxpayers out of millions. I'm with Hillary. This country did well when the Clintons were in charge last time."

428974	"Dear Mr. McMahan, It was not my purpose to impugn your credential as a marine biologist.  I only reported what was in your bio.  Your concerns about the antiquities act being the basis for this expansion are well understood.  The world is a dangerous place, lets leave it at that. The long line fishery does not fish the Papahanaumokuakea as its primary fishing grounds.  The biological technicians do a great job.  The technicians have only responsibilities assigned by NOAA. The technician (observers) for all intents are federal workers while the crew members are ""little brown men"", trafficked as human labor, paid $400 per month in cash, pay no taxes and by mail or wire send money home to foreign countries. I am against trafficking in human being.  Crimes against humanity as defined by the UN.  Observers do not report on human trafficking.  Not in their job description.  But it does exist at Port Honolulu in the fishing industry.  I asked for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer on trafficking."
5269280	"In all seriousness:  Seeing  a President (or any leader for that matter) publicly complain about ""unfair"" treatment (during a speech, no less) is just embarrassing to watch.    Doesn't this man-child have any sense of pride or backbone?   
This is the man who is supposed to make the clear, hard decisions when things REALLY get tough.... and he's whining about his treatment by his own domestic press?

The one core competency of ""The Right""  on both sides of the border is their ability to always whine about being a ""victim"".

Suck it up, Snowflakes."

517897	"The FBI stated they didn't have enough evidence and she has been investigated since the 90s, but any day now we will find evidence that she did it. 

Any day now she will be found guilty.

Meanwhile, Trump runs around opening talking about sexually assaulting women and refers to his daughter as a piece of ass he would like to date, and the integrity question falls to Clinton?

What reality do you live in?"
5825040	"When are you people of the political left going to get over the Jian Ghomeshi trial? The man was acquitted and it is just like you tell conservatives who complain on this forum after losing the election - get over it! 

I am sure these judges are properly qualified otherwise they wouldn't be judges."
513907	"Touching women inappropriately,  without their consent is not ""silly, little crap,"" Nicholas.  It's abuse.  It is not okay.  The right of all women to live and work in a fear-free environment is not negotiable.  Ever.  Incidentally,  the language Trump used is the language of predators."
5776740	"The Damore essay parroted the biology and psychology he cited.  Jordan Peterson, Phd. in psychology with a clinical practice has seconded Damore's citations adding that forty other specialists in the field stated he had correctly applied the material.

Henein made no such assertions and her training is law.  She ridiculed Damore's presentation with an attempt at being cute, ""Golly gee, if only I could overcome my natural biological disposition toward feelings rather than ideas..."".  It is at this point she confuses a statistical distribution of traits as a specific criticism of the female of the species.

As Damore's critique of the echo chamber at Google was validated by his expulsion so has Henein's fit of pique in defense of 'woman' reinforced the existence of her in-group bias.   How sad to see in-group bias be the source of perceived injury as it is in Henein's article,.  Sadder still is her intolerance for what she has misread as a critique of all women when she speaks for them."

When you elect a lawyer whose entire reason for being is warring with the oil companies, he will make war against the oil companies regardless of the jobs lost, the economics involved, or the outcome for the state.

The only way to monetize natural gas on the slope is convert it to synthetic diesel and batch ship it down TAPS for sale around the Pacific Rim. 

Warring against the producers - our business partners - will only serve to chase more jobs out of the state, all to the cheers and adulation of the Backbone / Alaska First Walker supporters.  One of the reasons people quit shooting themselves in the foot is because it hurts too much.  Appears the economic crash has not yet been sufficiently painful yet.  But it will.  It will.  Cheers -"
578805	Yesterday my friend voted at early voting and there were two men wearing Trump shirts inside where they vote, encouraging others to vote for Trump. I'm quite sure that's illegal.
5324505	"""I can't understand why it is verboten to criticize islam"".  Maybe because ""Islam"" is a stupid thing to critcise.  It's one thing to oppose the retrograde attitudes toward women demonstrated by adherents of, say, Wahabiism.  It's something quite different -- quite ignorant, in fact -- to conflate the attitudes of, say, the Doukhobors, as a  condemnation of all Christians."

916748	"What utter stupidity . . . to compare the gift of life to the gift of an opera ticket.  ""Incoherent"" more aptly describes the thinking of many women, including you, on the meaning of the life of in the womb.  Pregnancy is an ""instrument of torture""?  A ""perversion"" of the gift of sex and consequent life?  What spoiled offspring the left has produced.  Ingrates even to God.  Someone should write an opera about the year-by-year degradation of a culture that produces such women."
584385	"But when a woman dies because of a self-induced abortion, where is your ""pro-life""? Your ""abortion is always wrong"" seems simplistic at best.

1034867	This woman is often on as a panelist on Power and Politics; she's extremely long winded, adds very little to the discussion and is obviously very taken with the sound of her own voice... I dont think she would be a thoughtful addition to any cabinet.
5556788	"AT: Just to be clear:  Crum didn't state....Crum presented the results of a study by a religious organization.  That study showed that 70% of the women in the sample who had abortions ""self-identified"" as Christians.  I did not state ""the majority of women who got abortions were Christians""  It would be extremely presumptuous of me to say who is and who is not a Christian.  That, in fact, is the whole point of my post.  You presume to define who IS and who IS NOT a Christian with the contention that those women who had abortions and self-identified as Christians were, ipso facto, not, in fact,  Christians.  I can only shake my head in wonderment that someone could assert their right to judge whether another person is a Christian or not.  Do you realize the monumental presumptuousness of your position?  Gary Crum"
332259	66 in total, 39 in the old, and 27 in the new. those that study say there are no real issues, though non-believers often tout there are. i am in error, i thought it was the woman at the well. but that is not the point. the point is this: Jesus did not just wink and smile and say go on your way, He said: Go and sin no more. I am Protestant- so have no knowledge of the Catholic beliefs about the books included in their version. I am not concerned with exactly when the books were written- but believe the Bible to be, as stated, wholly inspired and without error. but then you say you studied alot, but i don't know what ccd is.

947382	"People generally fear what they don't understand.  They don't understand how devout religious believers can chop the heads off those they differ from, or how they can use children as sex slaves, or how they can mutilate young women in a barbaric manner, or how they can throw those with different sexual identities off rooftops.


Perhaps if can help them understand, the hatred would stop?"

5994852	"No, don't try and turn it around on me. If you all want to call 3 or 4 cells combined ""a baby"" and take control of  another person's life (aka a woman that is expected to spend 9 months to meet your morality), that is on you. And if you want to pontificate further and call her a s**t, that is also on you gentlemen (and I use that term loosely).  And my point is that people like you that want to take that control of somebody else's life , are fine and dandy with washing your hands as soon as the child is born. That is the ultimate hypocrisy."
5455897	"Strong ones, eh?  How much can they bench press?

And I do hope, as they extol modesty, that they are demonstrating that they don't leer at women, and treat them with respect, and never make sexist jokes, and would never ever even consider voting for somebody who joked about sexually assaulting women because his money means he can get away with it."

5232067	"""But alcohol has played a surprisingly important role in defining this nation, ""

Yet in-spite of the statement that correct claim, this article has skipped over the role alcohol and prohibition played in earning women the right to vote. 

Women's suffrage and prohibition went hand in hand. First-wave feminists pushed hard for prohibition. And those who supported prohibition supported first-wave feminism. The relationship between the two is a bit more nuanced but no historian would deny the essential connection.

It is rather shameful that this article misses this point, especially considering that it comes off as an understandable source on alcohol's ""role in defining this nation."""

978541	So far, 62 comments - and not one stating that this woman is in mortal danger.  He will not stop, he will not be done until he has destroyed her.  Meaning death.  This type cannot be cured with jail time.  She is his possession and obsession.  This will not end well.  I suggest she change her patterns and maybe even move from the state.

It will be worth it. The public and jury will understand. Chief Ballard will understand. You are terrified and have no means of escape. The cops are not around to help. So shoot, shoot, shoot them until they are dead. I guarantee you a wave of calm will finally engulf you and bring everlasting peace.  They will no longer rape another female again. You will become the best spokesperson for women against rape.
462670	Johnson enjoys his strongest support from younger voters.  I've always said if the Republican Party could decouple itself from the social issues and focus on truly trimming the budget they'd be unbeatable.  Opposing the rights of women and sexual minorities, as well as the entrenched racism that always got a nod and a wink and that Trump has brought to the surface, are what's demographically killing them.  There's nothing about basic economic conservatism that needs to be anti-women or anti-minority or anti-gay/lesbian.  The Republicans have chosen to be that way.  Johnson represents a way out of the hole they've dug for themselves if Republicans are willing to pay attention.
5492083	Yes, businesses (and people, businesses being people, right?) should be able to pollute all they want, not hire blacks, pay women less, and hire 12 year olds to be be strippers.
5495740	"Just incase you're curious about Breitbart's history: they used to post much more inflammatory articles. They had a banner section called ""Black Crime"" (as if to imply that only black people commit crimes), and Milo Yiannopoulos used to routinely opine about how women should not be in the workplace. Really awful crap. Now, they have pivoted to publishing less dramatic material (they'll often just repost an AP story that they think their readers can get worked up about), but they rely on their comments section to do the work. I challenge you to scroll through a comments section in Breitbart and not find someone professing that we should commit genocide against blacks or Muslims, or else threatening politicians and journalists with rape and murder. Breitbart doesn't *need* to write awful stuff anymore, in order to be America's leading site for the radicalization of white nationalist terrorists. I will continue to work assiduously to shut it down."
5379086	"To repeat what Trid said so succinctly and correctly -

5437711	"I believe that the media treatment of Clinton has left some unanswered questions. Why in the matter of her server was all the focus directed on the question of its legality or otherwise. A tiny tiny minority of voters could get really worked up over the hair splitting on that question - they simply have no connection to that sort of argument in their daily life.

OTOH, the real scandal was the abysmal stupidity of that woman running an isolated server in her home. Had that been made the issue then there would have been tens of thousands of Americans (IT college graduates etc.) who would have been able to appreciate her surpassing incompetence and been happy to discuss that at the dinner table. 

By focusing on the esoteric legal questions the media helped Clinton avoid being revealed as the relic from the past that she is."

6111809	"Minority borrowers are still more likely to get turned down for conventional mortgage loans than white people with similar credit scores. An Urban Insititute data analysis found that mortgage denial rates from government-sponsored servicers are higher for black applicants with bad credit than for white applicants with bad credit:

A study published this year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age. When participants were told that the boys, both black and white, were suspected of crimes, the disparity in perceptions of age and innocence became more stark:

White Americans use drugs more than black Americans, but black people are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites. Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found."
373607	"A man with principles, eh?

Do men with principles corrupt an electoral mandate like the 2014 Democratic primary results when tens of thousands of people voted for Byron Mallott as their gubernatorial nominee for the 2014 e election?

What kind of men intentionally cast away, gut, and nullify all those votes and voters as if they never even existed?

Men with principles would stand solid by their principles - not change them as the winds change direction.

Men like Walker and Mallott have unequivocally shown that they do NOT respect the democratic process. They proved, when they nonchalantly dropped  their principles at the drop of a hat, that their political careers are more important than our orderly process of government and democracy. 

Walker and Mallott have been lying to Alaskans ever since...because they lack good principles."

5473604	"It is imperative that focus be maintained upon revelation of, accountability, penitance for and reform to prevent sexaul abuse of children and youth. 
The appropriate reforms go far beyond ""words"", the same patriarchal clerics,  the same clerical environments of formation, administration, ""amending"" their notes or inviting an ""expert"" to speak, ""monitoring behaviour"", i.e., tweaking the system. 
The operative institutional psychosis is ""abuse"". 
The child victims define the ultimate degree of harm. Victims though, are in a continuum with women, reason, truth, tradition, mission. The ""abuser"", whether the sick, opertunistic cleric or the perverted enabler, denier, obfuscator is imbedded in an institution that seems by its very core of presupposition to render abuse inevitable- because it embodies the intrinsic abuse of authority. 
It is one thing to exist within an institution that is ""imperfect"".
It is another to exist within an institution that denies the quest, refusing to see."

And don't you DARE try to put the transgenders (.2%, if even that) on an equal playing field with the MAJORITY of Anchorageites, who are only trying to protect the PRIVACY and safety of their women and children.
You are against that! How dare ADN push your garbage of anti-women, anti-children, anti-family and anti-decency.

698658	I just got back from a 60 km round trip on slippery winter roads and once again I am astounded at how clueless some people can be.  Modern cars are too quiet and comfortable and give the impression of moving much slower than they are so some people drive too fast.  I understand people driving slower than I would like because some people are nervous and unsure or might have poor tires.  What I don't understand are the people who drive above the speed limit and/or tailgate.  For some reason, and I know I'm going to get heck for saying this, the worst offenders are young 20 something women driving small cars.   They're absolutely brain dead as they rocket along in the fast lane 20 km or more above the speed limit.  Dodge pickup drivers are the worst tailgaters.

919152	The recently elected president is the model par excellence of a bully: he bullies women by forcing himself on them sexually, he bullies people who aren't white with his racist rhetoric, he bullies immigrants when he lies about their contributions to American society, he lies about trade. Trump is a psychopath as his behavior shows, and like his supporters he wants to do as much harm as possible to to the people he stigmatizes. He behaves like a criminal but has thus far gotten away with it. It's going to take more anti-racist white people to call out his filthy minions like Sessions and Bannon--these are the architects of his fascist regime.
6239500	Why is it that usual liberals and free-thinkers like yourself, Cognitive Dissonance, take the side of the extreme conservatives ( like the 1% of Canadian muslims who endorse extreme Wahhabism) over the Stephen Harper moderate -type conservatives on this issue.   You wrap yourself up in the greatness of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms when it comes to freedom of religion, but only in the one case of Wahhabi -islam whipped women of the niqab wearing sort, who would actually be better off if you supported the their rights of a woman in its banning of niqabs and burqas.     This is the one issue where you chose to side with extreme conservative over the obvious choice of liberating oppressed women.    How do you reconcile this?

Did Ms. Clinton lie about the inspiration of the attacks in Benghazi on Sept 11, 2012 for political expediency?  Yes, she did.  The evidence is very clear.  It is VERY relevant.

Did Ms. Clinton lie about the purpose and coverup of her Private Server?  Yes, she did.  The evidence is very clear.  It is VERY relevant.

There is more.  But, those that argue that Ms. Clinton is exceptionally qualified, and that she is a woman don't care about relevant facts."

The trouble is one they are firmly established than the country's laws fail to apply and people entering those communities are attacked or harassed. Women (not of the community) are routinely called ""sluts"" and other vulgar names and sometimes even sexually assaulted.  

 The Police are way too politically correct to arrest anybody from those zones unless it's an international incident when they are forced to.

639464	"Like all good dictators, Castro started out defending the poor and downtrodden, but he went off the rail when he realized that absolute power was a good thing for him.  In the end, Cubans are still poor and downtrodden.  Yes they can read, but what is the point of learning how to read and write when all you can read is government approved propaganda and you can only write things that the government approves.  In the meantime, Castro lived a very nice life - reports have him stashing away millions (kind of like Arafat), enjoying over 22 luxury houses, high speed motorboats and the company of many young and beautiful women.  

Trudeau may have seen him as an kind uncle, but the Trudeau family never really interacted with real Cuban - the fact the Justin is blind to the disgust that many Canadians have towards Castro demonstrates that he lives in a very, very thick bubble.

Private businesses are not charities, their goal is to make as much money as possible, and if high-talented staff are willing to work at a relatively lower levels of pay (my guess is that relatively low is multiples of $100,000 for a big law firm) then so be it.
Both John Tory and Kevin O'Leary have stated that if a female executive feels under paid and can prove that they are profitable to the company, then they have every right to bring that up with senior management.  Tory stated that men are far more likely to make the case for pay raises than women and O'Leary stated that the most profitable companies he owns are run by women and he will pay them accordingly."

I take those things with a grain of salt because you never know how they are edited, but Hillary was anti-gay marriage until it became politically expedient for her in the past couple of years.  Hillary's campaign staff started the Obama birther controversy.  Hillary called black men ""Super Predators"".  I could go on.

919838	"S Todd,

Tyranny definition: ""cruel, unreasonable, or arbitrary use of power or control.""

The hysteria of which you speak, is what has driven the radical right to respond so irrationally and so out of proportion against a group (Muslims) which makes up some 15-20% of Earth's population.  More Americans are killed by refrigerators than so-called Islamic terrorists, but you don't see Trump and the radical right banning refrigerators. The reason much of the world is so concerned about these developments is that the lunatic is now running the asylum.  A man with no sense of caution, proportion, justice, calculation, or justice.  

Moreover, given the economic and military capabilities the US has at its disposal, this is very much our and the rest of the worlds business, as much so as one must be concerned with Kim Jong Un having nuclear weapons and missile capabilities.  It is a crisis because we now live in an age where reason and truth no longer guide US actions and cannot be trusted."

Catholics depend upon the priesthood for the offering of the Mass and the conferal of certain Sacraments, If women cannot be ordained then they cannot offer the Mass nor confer the Sacraments reserved to the priesthood nor in the case of ''women bishops' maintain the apostolic succession without which the Church would cease to exist. In such a situation whether Christ was our Saviour or not would be immaterial.

In the past it has been seen that true fascism rewards anti-feminism and the ownership of the state by a few corporatcrats.  
It is the low income Trump voters who are mostly to blame, they voted against their own interests in actually believing the New York Con Man. Good luck finding health care when the ACA dies. Good luck getting women's reproductive rights recognized when the Supreme Court overturns Roe V. Wade.

Those who are in favor of women's ordination are WAY behind the times. We are entering into the time when all things are to be restored through the Elijah Message: tithes and offerings, festivals, tassels, head coverings and long dresses for women, etc. Straight testimony to the Laodiceans is now going forth and the shaking is coming; those who are faithful to the Scriptures will remain, while those who do not remain true to Bible standards will be cast out of the SDA remnant church.

That so called incriminating photo of Swift and Mueller and third girl proved nothing. Swifts dress was not up as she said, he does not appear to have his hand on her butt and she is smiling in the photo, If Swift is in the midst of being sexually assaulted then why the hell is she smiling? like the OJ Simpson case this case reeks of a celebrity winning a case because of celebrity. This poor guy cant get a job now and this snob Swift goes on to make her millions. The stupid jury was probably impressed because she was big shot Taylor Swift.

The GOP campaign also desired after the Romney defeat to grow their appeal to voters beyond their base. Trump had no big plan for a nationwide campaign except to keep on speaking and that problem is a big one since Trump needs crossover voters to vote and he needs big blocks of voters like women, blacks and Latinos and they are not on board with him.

Young black men are treated like enemy combatants by police and vigilantes rather than as someone in their custodial care. It is the police state mentality that needs changing and not just where black people are concerned. When the general will is not present, legislating morality results in police state action. It's a bad idea.
1055871	More empty rhetoric from someone who wants change to ensure that sexual assault 'survivors' are automatically imbued with 'believe-ability'.  What I find to interesting about this entire series of narratives from primarily female writers is that they do not want to talk about evidence, the trial process or as so many other comments have noted, the probability of convictions were they to get their way.  As I have said before, this is about power, plain and simple.  These people want to have the power to implement poorly thought out change in our criminal justice system to ensure they can force their viewpoint on the rest of Canada.

I've also spoken to other female family members, colleagues and other acquaintances who confirm the same. And you have an absolute cheek in daring to suggest I don't have a clue of the 'extent of the problem'. What I do have is a sixth sense(sic) that suggests to me that we're in the midst of yet another campaign to gain political leverage for the 'feminist' movement. In fact, the recent howls of outrage by them in regard to the attention being given to transgender people shows just what I'm talking about. Maybe take the mote out of your own eye before accusing others?

The NFL is an entertainment business. They sell 3+ hour events to the public. The main event is the game itself, but if you've ever been to a game or seen one on TV, you know there's more to the event than the game alone. There's pregame activities and post-game activities as well. PUBLIC activities, that are part of the event that the employees are there putting on for the public. One of the pieces of the whole event is a performance of the national anthem, on the field, usually on TV, where the cameras put the players, coaches, staff, etc on display standing and showing respect for the national anthem.

You could complain about not liking that the national anthem is part of the pregame, but the fact is that IT IS. And like any employees, NFL employees are expected to partake in that ceremony as PART OF THE JOB. Perfectly legal for them to make it a job requirement."

""And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.""

Zacchaeus sought sight of the Lord and was changed by Jesus' call. Because of His confession and repentance, Jesus happily proclaimed that salvation had come to him, and that the tax collector was now “a son of Abraham” - a reference to Zacchaeus’ faith because those who have the faith of Abraham can truly be called the sons of Abraham (Galatians 3:7). Then Jesus responded to those who had murmured against Him, saying, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10). As Jesus said elsewhere, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick” (Matthew 9:12).

The account isn't a social statement."
5146077	"Empirical proof God chose Trump for president rather than Satan choosing him?  Thought not.  The Lord may work in mysterious ways, but appointing a man denied the Kingdom of Heaven by Jesus Christ himself (Matthew 19:24), who violates the will of God through his sordid marriages (Mark 10:9), who has admitted to appalling sexual depravity outside of wedlock and whose defining character trait, beyond a child-like tendency towards temper tantrums and disgusting ego  is greed . . . well, that seems implausibly mysterious.

More logical to accept that the 2016 election in general was proof of Satan ascendant in the world, forcing a choice of President Snowflake or Shillary onto America or, at the very best, to see Trump and Clinton as a tribulation inflicting on America for decades of wickedness both in personal affairs and inflicted on the world.

The politicians didn't say, of course, is that if these illegals are deported CITIZENS would replace them contributing. Then there is the Public Safety concerns.

Yes illegal aliens through DACA are buying homes, paying taxes, etc. The goal is for our CITIZENS to be employed, buying homes and paying taxes. Not citizens from other country's.

OK, but it's clear to us that that is simply part of her pathology. Climbing to the top of the power-wielding heap is her hobby and her religion, her everything. She has long ago come to terms with not being liked, even by her own husband, and chosen instead to be feared by those over whom she wields power. Perhaps she thinks only then will anyone like her. But it is in vain, for who truly likes anyone who will lie so repeatedly and transparently, and use her power to evade the legal consequences of her actions? Who really thinks the very first woman to hold the Presidency should be a likely felon and borderline sociopath who will taint that feat forever? Brooks does not seem to understand that the reason Hillary doesn't show us her sanctuaries is because they would only shock us more than her phoniness.

If someone described you as a literal vampire, then claimed that didn't mean you drank blood, would you so easily laugh it off? No, I wouldn't waste my time reading such a book, but then as H.L.

“No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.”
Dr. Mary Ann Minor, former head of the women's shelter in P.A. told me many years ago that there are lots of Satanists out here -- many in the sheriff's dep't. Apparently nothing has changed there, either. Anyone who would defend or make light of vampires is either ignorant, or complicit."

5634769	"The NBA point was to prove what a meritocracy is. I agree that it is more difficult to have a true meritocracy in tech and wasn't arguing otherwise.

My point was that this piece contradicts the concept of meritocracy. Negro league baseball players could prove that they were good enough to join the meritocracy of MLB baseball, and ultimately they did exactly that. I'm seeing no such argument from feminists. What they are saying is that there are systemic, structural problems that prevent women from gaining representation in tech. This is a fair argument, but it still doesn't disprove that tech is (mostly) a meritocracy. 

Structural obstacles exist, but a white coal miner from West Virginia faces more obstacles to a tech career than an upper middle class girl who just graduated from Berkeley. Life is not fair, and neither is a meritocracy.

If women studied STEM instead of studying women's studies to study why not enough women were studying STEM, there would be more women in tech."

It is merely the only coercive means, and I fear there is much harm in embracing it."

Because of the glare, it is harder for me to see with the new lights.

But they have frequently been used in other countries for terrorist attacks, robberies, welfare claims fraud, etc.  This is why they have been banned in public in several countries including some Muslim majority countries. 

As to social isolation being a woman's choice, it isn't always.  I'd introduce you to a couple of teenage girls who defied their father's wishes on this but they are at the bottom of the Rideau Canal near Kingston.

Courts do err.

Ban face coverings.

Ms. Doolittle’s report can be interpreted many ways. Perhaps some Police forces are better at detecting lies. Perhaps some Police arrest people regardless of any real evidence to mitigate their unfounded rate.
Her stating statistics (2-8% is accepted false reporting rate) without citation of any kind is not unusual for feminists. They like to present “alternative truths” on a regular basis.
In the feminist bubble, it’s unfathomable the rate could be higher, cause you know…’sugar & spice & all things nice’.
I wonder, if after reviewing all the past cases the Police determine they are in fact unfounded, what will Ms. Doolittle’s response be?
Admission of a much higher unfounded rate than 2-8%?, admission that women may lie more often than she currently believes? I guess we'll have to wait and see...."

6246431	"We're not talking about one person here, W w. We're talking about all the feminists in Canada and their associated organizations. 

The issue of the face coverings some Muslim women wear has been active in Canada for years. Now it's culminated in a government violating the rights of those women. Yet there's been no concerted outcry by feminists against the violations. Have they been too busy all that time to speak out?

Let's call a spade a spade. The failure of feminists to address this particular rights abuse is a result of the rigidity of present-day feminism. It constrains women, just like the patriarchy does. At best, women outside the accepted norms of feminist ideology are shunned or patronized. At worst, those women will watch as feminists actively call for their fundamental rights to be violated.

5400664	"Like many other animals, human males are just generally seeking to climax (witness a dog's lack of concern for sexual partner), and we know from history that sexual desire for other men is learnable behavior (see Ancient Greece).  Different from other animals, humans were blessed with reason to distinguish between urges that ""make sense"" and those that don't.  So I'm not all that swayed by the ""homosexual"" animal argument.

Feelings have proven to be a poor way of selecting a mate.  For thousands of years parents picked their childrens' mates, and with good reason: they know their children, they know marriage, and they know human nature better than their children.  And most married people will tell you that feelings figure very little into how they manage their marriage and their lives.  And, for that matter, sex.  

So all these feelings and desire to engage in sodomy is really rather pointless, especially in light of sexual desire being learnable and love being non-sexual."

Sometimes a label means more than one type of person and people are complex, as well as the opinions about them. I think it is the extreme form of this religion, that people feel threatens the western model of the world which includes tolerance. Yes sometimes that translates into undifferentiated expressions of ""racism"" although it's a religion and that term is inaccurate in this context. Zenophobia is correct, but that's not as sexy for the SJW to rage against."

He told the flight attendant to make sure they got whatever they wanted and that he would pay for everything. He then went back in coach and visited every service member and talked with them. I think really that is why he was so well liked by others in show business. He had a very sharp tongue during his act, but outside of his act he was just a really nice guy.

And it took a full year for the state's crime lab to be able to test the DNA from this case?   It is clear that law enforcement is not being given the resources that it needs, if the state lab is backed up a full year in testing DNA evidence.

First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai.

5779504	Arenado's error was the most obvious mistake in the game, because it gave up the winning run, but I found the poor hitting with men on base to be even more costly. Arenado popping out with men on first and third in the fifth inning and only one out and Cargo grounding into a 3-6-3 double play in the seventh both snuffed out a scoring chances for the Rockies. It was simply a poor offensive performance outside of three solo shots.

President Trump was the leader of the ""Birther"" movement during Obama's candidacy and presidency.  He campaigned as virtually the anti-Obama.  Where Obama came off as an intellectual, a college professor, a chablis sipper who wouldn't be found drinking beer and cheering raucously with the guys for a sports team (regardless of his actual behavior in such circumstances),  Trump was one of the boys.  Obama was a social liberal, a supporter of gay rights, and women's rights, including women's right to choose abortion.  Neither of these positions really resonates with many traditional Catholics, who are very happy that Trump says he has had a conversion of conscience regarding abortion and would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.  I also wonder how many conservative Catholics really believe that President Obama was a secret Muslim."

I'm sure there would be plenty of non-profit organizations that would provide the pills for little or no cost for women who cannot afford them. Deregulation is the only option that both empowers women to make their own contraceptive choices and affirms religious liberty.  Instead, one silly regulation leads to a constitutional crisis. This is not how our country was intended to be.

There are often extenuating circumstances whereby a woman may need to have an abortion and it is none of your bloody business to interfere.  This is between the woman and her doctor - nobody else.  The POTUS has no business meddling with a law that is constitutional. A president cannot change the law but the president must uphold it because it is legal and this is not a Catholic country - the president must be president for all. So let's drop this nonsensical issue for God's sake and let's focus on more important and pressing issues such as a decent living wage for workers, free health care, free college tuition, better maternity leave for parents and changing the laws so that the fat cats don't get off Scot free from paying their fair share of taxes. These are the issues that would improve the quality of life.     Don't tell me we can't afford it - we are a wealthy nation when  we can fund wars.

All human beings are capable of care, thinking, and love to different degrees but all of these things are constitutively the same. The way people express represent these behaviors has something to do with the way they were raised or their inherent traits, but not gender.

The author's motive for cheer-leading Canada's dramatic gender shift in foreign aid is clear. The Liberal's will stop working with his organization if it doesn't comply with the government's feminist policy.

More importantly, what are we to say of a foreign aid program that's at least 95% devoted to the equality and empowerment of women? Feminism does not rank at the top of the human hierarchy of needs.

Because I can trace sexual abuses of youth and women, all the way to the 4th century in the Church--- much of it came from the highest ranks of the church.  And the laity did not bring it on.  It was begun by the clergy and the hierarchy, who felt that their exulted position entitled them to take advantage of the poorly educated women and the young.


For abuses within the church to cease---both spiritual and physical changes must occur.  If we only needed PRAYER----Jesus could have cured ZILLIONS of people just by praying.  But he wanted US to see that doing the Will of the Father, means taking the time, going out and DOING it.  Not just praying about it.  In his letter, St. James states ""what good is it if you say that you have faith, but do not have works.""  The people of Ireland have had enough of being 'preyed' upon.

Hey, it is as you say all relative.

Even though it has been widely supported by most of the very Catholic Filipino people for decades, it has been fought by the Catholic bishops.  And they have been winning that battle until the last few years.

How can such extreme abuse of children be allowed, even in Arizona?  Why did the State take no action to remove her from such a rotten environment?  We are all to blame!

I believe we can assume Hanchett was an emotional basket case that needed help, long before the crime.  It is understandable that she was in an abusive relationship at 18 years old.  Again, I must reiterate that our 'system' of mental health services is grossly deficient and under funded.  That is not to say that professionals could have 'saved' this poor individual, but at least she may have never gotten into the biker gang and the situation where she felt she had no option but killing another women."

I think one spoiled  celebrity lied like hell about this so called assault, stupid jurors believed this idiot because she is a celebrity.

As stated in comments below, where is the dignity and respect for ALL people?
 
If Pope Francis and the institutional  church are truly serious that ""so many senseless wars are being fought and acts of fratricidal violence are taking place ..."" and that change is vital,  then an obvious, beginning solution is including leaders of both genders in government and religious leadership.

Ten times as many white students as a percentage of the enrollment at UO than SJSU!  UO is ""diverse"" only by self declaration.  University of California schools are the real deal.  None have 40% white enrollees,  which is not the case at Stanford or USC,  both private schools,  and both over 40% white enrollment.  To which UCal administrators counter by saying affluent white students elect to go to private schools or out of state.  Many must be at UO,  which is less than 50%  Oregon resident enrollees.      

All these  schools have a  female majority as enrollees,  evidence that the public and taxpayers are still not doing enough for females."

508225	On the question of abortion. Since we are a democracy and not a theocracy, it is ok in my view that a Catholic can be against abortion but allow laws protecting abortion rights.  I say that because we have the choice not to engage in abortion as an individual and our individual choice is guided by our morals.  However, in addition to my own religious views that abortion, in general, is immoral (as is capital punishment), I see abortion as wrong because it is bad for the human species, the preservation of humanity. I guess what I am saying Is that abortion for me is an invalid form of birth control, but is a valid option for cases such as rape, incest and the life of the mother.  That may sound oxymoronic, but I try to see not the act of the abortion but the entire picture including the woman, the child and the rest of the family not just in an instant but a lifetime.

As for the women murdered by serial killers, they are almost all drug-addicted street sex workers, who have been a favourite target of serial killers since Jack the Ripper simply because they are easy prey - and sadly, indigenous women make up a disproportionate number of street sex workers in places like Vancouver and Edmonton.

Yes - we do agree on this.  

What you appear not to acknowledge, is that the current dispute between the GC and some Union and Local conferences, regards the ordination of a clerical class of NON-local ""elders"" that did not exist in the NT, but was introduced later by Protestant churches as a replacement for the Ordained Priesthood of the Orthodox churches.  

Present GC Working Policy explicitly allows Divisions to authorize election and ordination of women as Local Elders.  GC Working Policy also allows Divisions to Commission (but not Ordain) women as ministers.

Under present GC Working Policy, Commissioned Ministers can perform every function of an Ordained Minister save one thing only - they cannot be elected as Conference President.  This is the real ""glass ceiling"" in GC Working Policy.  

Basically you are arguing a different question than the one voted at San Antonio, Annual Council, etc."
5288935	I treat women who I see here in hijabs with the utmost of respect. My Christian relatives, the few remnants left in Turkey, emigrated to Australia a few years ago. Not only did they receive no respect in Turkey, they feared for their lives after a prominent journalist and a young member of the Turkish military was assassinated. Respect should go both ways. The answers that Anil Uskanli gave the interrogators reveals that he views himself as a victim. This is what the Turkish government is teaching its people, that they are victims of Western civilization.

6060098	For me, the power of John Palovitz's work is an indictment of Roman Catholicism and Evangelical Christianity in the U.S. (and I would add Europe).  The bottom line is that what these denominations are selling, people aren't buying.   People are no longer compelled by fear, shame, or guilt.  If Christianity is to reset itself the U.S. and Europe it will need to organize around radical hospitality, total authenticity, true diversity, and a​ true community.  This is a tremendous value shift which is far beyond personnel staffing or married male clergy.

Should a legitimate and critical opinion about a religion, or about certain aspects of a religion, be condemned along with racism or bigotry, which are both unambiguously undesirable attitudes about or towards other people?

For example, a person may feel that the Islamic burqa is an obstacle to integration in society, or they may feel it is discriminatory against women and girls.

The “stained blue dress” is what proved him a predator, a national disgrace and liar, got him convicted for lying to a judge, and led to his impeachment. The Arkansas State Bar took away his license to practice his profession.  Only you, not history nor any reasonable observer,  would see Ken Starr as the chief villain here.

Unity, warned against a mechanical interpretation of apostolic succession. ""To stand in the apostolic succession is not a matter of an individual historical chain, but of collegial membership in a collegium which, goes back to the apostles."" And although Kasper spoke of a ""re-evaluation"" of APOSTOLICAE CURAE, which declared Anglican orders null and void, he ultimately said "" a final solution can be found only in the larger contest of full communion in faith, sacramental life and shared apostolic vision."" In other words, broader criteria was called for (as Orthodox repeatedly state). He also noted that women bishops blocked the path of recognition of orders (as gay marriage and clerics in civil unions today). Catholics can do as they like and Anglicans can ""crash"" a Catholic Eucharist. But on the books, Anglican orders are still null, void."

I had one woman who was convinced that even though two road engineers looked at the roads in front of her house, that both, including the people back at the office who approve such plans, repaved the wrong road. How can trained people with 20-40 years experience make such a mistake? They don't.
The best analogy is to think of a house that needs painting. The best way to save money on painting is to paint it before the paint cracks. Once it cracks and starts to fall off, the paint has to be removed before it can be painted. If you had homes that need painting or paint removal and limited money, would you repaint  7 homes before they went bad or the one that has to have the paint removed? 
That is roughly the relative cost of repaving vs rebuilding a street. The county does not have the money to do it all, so they make value based choices."

5726281	It is possible, and likely logical, to respect a woman's right to choose and recognize that abortion in all but saving the mother's life is not the acceptable choice and recognize the situation is a travesty. We can, as a society, address the circumstances which result in women choosing abortion over bringing the child to term. If the circumstances can be addressed, the choice will be life rather than abortion. One characteristic of Democrats is we will look for common ground when we have differences and it is only in that way can we as a party curtail abortion. The conservatives generally, and Republicans usually, disdain finding common ground since they think it is tantamount to compromise which, like the bishops, believe that to be anathema. That's why 44 years after Roe v. Wade we have made zero progress on addressing the issue.

 Those who know best are ignored most.

The ""dialogue"" has been ongoing, but there has been no respect--indeed there's derision--for what the learned laity say. The hierarchy says 2+2=4! Enough! But the laity--comprising females--say, ""But we know firsthand that 3+1=4 is OK too. It's not a competition, Father.""    

From hierarchy there is no trust. In women. In lovers. In spouses. In parents. In science. In medicine. In intimacy. In lives lived and loved. Isn't that a sin too?

Consider:  Raymond Burke is more authoritative on human sexuality than is the dean of a medical school, a family doctor, a geneticist, a female theologian, or a sexually active Catholic wife and husband.

The fact that there are relatively fewer women in computer programming in spite of decades of affirmative action and encouraging women to enter the field, tells us something about our society and the desire/ability of women to perform that type of work.

Harth voluntarily withdrew the suit when her husband settled a parallel case. Trump has called the allegations ""meritless"".

The issues involve the theology of the Eucharist described in Hebrews, the iconic value of the elements and minister of the Sacrament, the divine constitution of the Sacrament, the identity of the one Sacrifice with the Mass in an anamnesis.

Attempting to rationalize it is precisely what led - in the West - to a series of destructive Eucharistic heresies."

It is a childish argument to indicate he did not say a specific word when his intent wass clear to the audience. Over the campaign Donald made many statements indicating his views on other races, women and religions.  Should I start with the Trump comment about the Mexican judge overseeing his trial.

I bet your fifth grade daughter will be really impressed with him.

Or St. Augustine, who demonstrated his new-found devotion to Christ by booting his concubine back to Africa where she never saw her (their) son again, so his mother could arrange his marriage to a girl he liked ""as soon as she was old enough.""

Nonetheless, when the first woman priest was brought in and celebrated mass for the first time there were a few grumbles but very soon people got over themselves. Even those who were the most resistant to change eventually embraced the curate (as the associate priest was called) because of her wonderful outsize personality, her engaging homilies, her wit, and her pastoral gifts.

Who wants to defend the San Francisco killer of the woman on the bay who had been deported five times and said he stayed in San Francisco because it was a sanctuary city?

Same thing for the LA gang bangers."
986508	Well, that's patently false. Typical whiny little bitch remark. Question: Has a Conservative ever taken responsibility for his or herself? Answer: Isn't it obvious?

If I thought he was capable of effective delegating, picking smart experienced people,  I would be less uncomfortable, But Trump appears to me to be someone who always has to be in charge and who will never truly delegate, or pick any advisors that appear smarter or more experienced than himself. He has already demonstrated this through his campaign by regularly picking inexperienced, no-named, yes men advisors, so that he always appears to be the smartest person in the room. The apparent psychological needs of this guy are scary to many of us.

Last night was almost run over crossing the street at a  4 way stop. Car stopped and I started to cross...she just hit the gas as is we were not there at all ( several of us crossing in a group).

Last week at a set of lights,with the walk signal green 2 of us started crossing only to have a woman come flying around the corner as if we were invisible. Saw us at last second, screeched her brakes and mounted the curb.  This was midday during a cloudy day (no sun in the eyes, no rain, etc).  Clueless selfish driver.

I think I will head out and buy one of those construction safety vests. It's the only chance I have of being seen."

ORS 163.415,  A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:

(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:

(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or

(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age; or

(3) As used in this section, ""dangerous substance"" means blood, urine, semen or feces. 

10 years ago I knew a Lane County Deputy that went to work one day and when he went into his office he passed by his secretary, said Good Morning, and put his hand on HER shoulder as a friendly, warm gesture. She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?"

Nothing. I'm white, older, and single. I've got two kids, but the women wanted to run around. So what are you going to do? They were not interested in being tied down in a marriage. I'm not into marriage and it's legal burdens either. It's something tied to religion, and I don't believe in fairy tales. 

So roll out your citations showing us how good blacks had it in this country pre-Civil Rights Act of 1964. Good luck with that."
577362	There's no defending trying to use a screen name to harass another. When you man up and use a screen name to identify yourself with, and not to harass another commenter, then your arguments might be worth listening to. Otherwise you're just trolling.
572054	And your reminder of that does what? What about the death of 58,000 of our men, many drafted, sent to their death makes you babble off such a stupid comment? Smartass!
